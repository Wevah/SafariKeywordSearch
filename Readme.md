Safari Keyword Search
=====================

This is a simple Safari extension to enable keyword search from the address bar. The following searches are included:

- **a**: amazon.com
- **down**: downforeveryoneorjustme.com
- **e**: ebay.com
- **g**: google.com
- **gm**: maps.google.com
- **imdb**: imdb.com
- **so**: stackoverflow.com
- **w**: en.wikipedia.org
- **wa**: wolframalpha.com
- **y**: youtube.com

To edit or delete these, or add your own, right-click any web page and select “Keyword Search Settings”. Here you can add keywords and search URLs, and delete or modify the existing ones. Put `@@@` in the search URL to insert the search string. It is also possible to have keyword expansions without search strings.

The url for the `Default` keyword is used when no other keyword is provided, and what is entered into the address bar doesn't look like a URL. This is set to Googles “I am feeling lucky” search by default.
